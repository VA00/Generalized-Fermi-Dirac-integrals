2021-01-23 v0.25 

Minor upgrade. Updated Mathematica MathLink compilation instructions
for use with $VersionNumner 12.1. Missing files included.

2020-07-24 v0.24 

Major upgrade, Sommerfeld and poly-log series with hypergeometric 2F1 and Kummer U terms for extreme positive and negative chemical potentials.

Minor version 0.22 upgrade. Added
fixedFfermi functions and tranlated
into plain C gauss-fermi.f from F.X.T.
This is mandatory step into fair
comparison of gauss-based subdivision
method with Tanh-Sinh method. Both must
use fixed and tabulated  abscissas and weights,
with AVX-aligned tables (divisible by 4; 
e.g. 5-point quadrature waste entire
AVX cycle to compute fifth integrand).

A lot of minor bugfixes, coverage tests
and precision tests were made. Some
unexpected behavior between icc and gcc
compiled versions has been found. 
In general, icc results appear both
more accurate and calculated faster.





2014-02-12

Version 0.21. Library ready to deploy. Coverage test
made, some under/overflow and cancellation 
bugs fixed. Prototype quickFfermi functions
added, aimed at full utilization of the
AVX/AVX2.


2013-11-09

Version 0.2 started. Only Tanh-Sinh versions of G- and F-
functions are now included.

Second step, goal rel. error
changed from 4*DBL_EPSILON to sqrt(DBL_EPSILON).
Since every doubling of sampling points
should in principle double number of significant digits,
this seems to be appropriate. Use of 4*DBL_EPSILON
in fact caused accuracy drop with doubled points,
and sometimes in infinite while loop.
